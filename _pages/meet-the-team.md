**Biography**

Dr. Min Xu is an Assistant Professor at the [Computational Biology Department](http://cbd.cmu.edu) (with a Courtesy Appointment at the [Robotics Institute](https://www.ri.cmu.edu)) within the [School of Computer Science](https://www.cs.cmu.edu) at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu). He serves as training faculty at the [Joint CMU-Pitt Ph.D. Program in Computational Biology](http://www.compbio.cmu.edu). He also serves as training faculty at the [Master of Science in Computer Vision](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/education/academic-programs/master-of-science-computer-vision) (MSCV) program at CMU. He is an investigator at the [National Center for Multiscale Modeling of Biological Systems](https://mmbios.pitt.edu).

Dr. Xu’s career has centered on developing computer vision and machine learning methods for the study of cellular systems using imaging and omics data. He started his research career in the field of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics since 2000\. His early work focused on developping machine learning methods for the analysis of functional genomics data. Since 2008, he started working on developping computer vision methods for the analysis of Cellular Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET) 3D image data. He designed structural pattern mining methods and first demonstrated the feasibility of De Novo extraction of structures and spatial organizations of macromolecular complexes in single cells using Cryo-ET data. His current research focus on Cryo-ET derived modelling of cellular organization at molecular resolution.

Dr. Xu has published over 60 research papers in peer-reviewed top journals and conferences, such as PNAS, Bioinformatics, ISMB, CVPR, ICCV, and MICCAI. He serves as PI of US NIH R01 and NSF awards.

Dr. Xu received a B.E. in Computer Science from the Beihang University, M.Sc from School of Computing at the National University of Singapore, M.A. in Applied Mathematics from the University of Southern California (USC), and Ph.D. in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from USC. He was a postdoctoral researcher at USC.

**Dr. Xu does research for fun, and he enjoys working with highly talented and motivated students.**
